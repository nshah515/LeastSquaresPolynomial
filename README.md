# LeastSquaresPolynomial

Least Squares: Given a set of points you will find a polynomial of degree
n that approximates the points minimizing the error squared.
Input:
Sample input representing the points (0, 45.13),(1, 51.71),(2, 60.17),(3, 64.83),
(4, 65.24),(5, 65.17),(6, 67.65),(7, 79.8),(8, 96.13),(9, 115.19),

where the first number corresponds to the number of points and the second
number is the degree of the desired polynomial.
Output:
(a) The coefficients of the polynomial, separated by spaces:
43.9719 13.4363 -3.3048 0.3005
(b) A plot like the one shown on lecture notes
